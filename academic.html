                <p>Studying is about training your brain into recalling information easily.</p> <p>Organising yourself by making a timetable, and <i>sticking to it</i> is the easiest way to do this.</p> 
                <p>Here's some tips for making a great timetable:</p>
                <ul class="pulloutlist">
                    <li><mark>Be honest</mark> with the time you actually want to spend studying after school - <span>blank out spaces</span> for when you are doing extra-curricular activites or want to spend time with family and friends. </li>
                    <li>Make your study sessions short. <p>No one really wants to be in their room for <span>5 hours</span> trying to study for their biology test the next day.</p> Training your brain to study for about <mark>25 minutes at a time with 5 minute breaks</mark> in between is the best way to get the most work done without tiring yourself out. </li>   
            <li>Having trouble sticking to your timetable?
                <br><span>Start small.</span> <br>Try and do something from each of your subjects for at least 10 minutes each day. <p>Whether this be copying your notes from class into another book, doing a few questions from a textbook or watching a video explaining a concept you are stuck on, reviewing your work after class forces you to remember information your teacher has taught earlier in the day.</p> </li>

                <p>Although we all learn differently, some learning styles are just better than others for certain subjects.</p>  <p>Here are some clues which could help you study for each of your classes.</p>
               <ul class="pulloutlist">
                   
                   <p class="subheading">maths</p> 
                   <li>Make the time to simply churn your way through the type of questions you find most <span>challenging</span> (e.g. factorising expressions in algebra, angle rules in geometry) as this is the only way you can train yourself to remember the different ways you can get to an answer.</li>
                   
                   <p class="subheading">english</p> 
                   <li> 
                    Studying for English can be more personalised for your learning style (e.g. either making flashcards or writing out quotes from the text several times). As well as writing timed plans for practise essays, I've found making brainstorms or mindmaps containing color and pictures is extremely helpful in <span>condensing all the analysis</span> you have done, onto one page.</li>
                 
                   <p class="subheading">science</p> 
                   <li>
                   You can really personalise the way you study for Science as well; look at using flashcards, practise questions in textbooks, rewriting and condensing notes, having discussions with friends or family about concepts or even using a writeboard, play dough or modelling clay to physically draw or make a function you are trying to explain. 
                       <p>One tip would be to <span>ask your teacher for a list of all the topics</span> you are going to learn in a certain area (e.g. Under the section 'Matter' some sub-topics could be 'Particles', 'States of Matter' and 'The Periodic Table').</p> <p>On a separate piece of paper, write as much as you can remember about that topic, and afterwards check your notes to see what you still need to learn.</p></li>
                   
                   <p class="subheading">languages</p> 
                   <li>
                    To learn new words, as well as writing them down or making flashcards, repeating them to yourself constantly or even making a song/rap can be helpful</li>
                  
                
                </ul>
